    <h1>UniScript is Coming Soon</h1>

  <p>
   <b>UniScript is a little language that compiles into C'Dent.</b> C'Dent
   compiles into all your favorite Object Oriented languages like Perl, Python,
   Ruby and Node.
  </p>

  <p>
    UniScript is just one of many language <b>syntaxes</b> for C'Dent. C'Dent
    is a programming language that is defined only by its model. Any syntax
    that can compile into the C'Dent model is considered a valid C'Dent
    syntax.
  </p>

  <p>
    UniScript is mostly a superset of CoffeeScript. If you are comfortable
    writing JavaScript modules in CoffeeScript, you'll soon be able to write
    them for several programming languages at once!
